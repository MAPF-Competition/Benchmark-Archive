# The League of Robot Runners Benchmark Archive

Welcome to the League of Robot Runners Benchmark Archive!
At the end of each year's competition, we release the benchmark instances and best-known solutions for the competition. This allows researchers and newcomers to compare their algorithms on our problem instances and build upon the best-known solutions and algorithms that created these solutions.

## What to find here

For each year's League of Robot Runners competition, you will find:
- Evaluation instances and example problems that were used in the competition.
- Best-known solutions for the evaluation instances.
- Solution metrics and cross-references to implementations that produced the solutions.
- Problem generators (Coming soon).
